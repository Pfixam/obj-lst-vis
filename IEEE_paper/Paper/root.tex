	References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. If at all possible, references should be commonly available publications.

	\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}    % This command serves to balance the column lengths
										% on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
										% the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
										% This command does not take effect until the next page
										% so it should come on the page before the last. Make
										% sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
